# AleAnd - Software & Data Engineer

Results-driven Software & Data Engineer with **9+ years of commercial experience**, specializing in building scalable,
data-intensive distributed systems on the **Java** platform. Currently operating in a Solution Architect capacity in the **BigData
field**, I lead the design and development of modern **Data Lakehouse systems**, aligning complex technical solutions with
strategic business goals. Key responsibilities include architecture design, stakeholder engagement, R&D initiatives, team
mentoring, and technical interviewing.

Bringing over 5 years of **Java backend development experience**, I have a strong background in building **Spring
Framework**â€“based **microservices** and service-oriented architectures (**SOA**). Iâ€™ve worked across diverse domains and team
structures â€” from agile 2-person teams to large-scale 40-member groups â€” delivering robust, maintainable systems. My
experience spans enterprise solutions using Camunda, as well as scientific computing projects involving distributed
simulations with OpenHLA and GIS technologies. Known for rapidly adapting to new environments and leading effective
remote collaboration.

Passionate about solving complex engineering challenges and shaping end-to-end technical vision. **Crypto-friendly** and
highly enthusiastic about the convergence of **data engineering**, **AI/ML**, and **decentralized technologies**. Actively seeking a
role where I can apply deep technical expertise and leadership to drive innovation and business value.
